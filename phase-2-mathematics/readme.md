## 🎯 Objective

Strengthen mathematical reasoning and structured problem solving through:

- Prime number logic  
- Divisibility analysis  
- Number decomposition  
- Mathematical pattern construction  
- Algorithmic efficiency awareness  

This phase transforms raw loop control into mathematical intelligence.
